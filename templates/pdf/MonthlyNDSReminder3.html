    <p>Dear Sir,
      <br />
      <br />
      Greetings from Infomerics Ratings!
      <br />
      <br />
      Kindly refer to our mail dated {{reminder2_date}} and subsequent Reminder-1 & Reminder-2 whereby you have been advised to
      submit No-Default Statement (NDS) as on {{month_ended_date}}.
      <br />
      <br />
      This is in compliance with SEBI guidelines which prescribes every rated entity to submit the statement.
      <br />
      <br />
      It is however noted that NDS statement has not been submitted so far. We have requested you to submit the same
      immediately for regulatory compliance.
      <br />
      <br />
      We trust you are aware about the implications for non-submission of the statement and would not like to default as a
      non-complying entity.
      <br />
      <br />
      Please note that in case the NDS statement is not submitted in time, the rating can be revised as 'Issuer Not
      Cooperating' . Please comply immediately.
      <br />
      <br />
      <br />
      Please click here to fill NDS (valid for 48 hours).
      <br />
      <br />
      Kindly do the needful immediately. Incase of any query, please feel free to call at +91-8929802915, 011-41410244.
      <br />
      <br />
      <br />
      <br />
      Note: To enable you submit NDS, as per system in place, an OTP will be generated on your mobile registered with us.
      Simultaneously an e-mail will also be sent wherein OTP number will be intimated. You can obtain the OTP from any
      source.
      <br />
      <br />
      <br />
      <br />
      Thanks & Regards,
          <br />
