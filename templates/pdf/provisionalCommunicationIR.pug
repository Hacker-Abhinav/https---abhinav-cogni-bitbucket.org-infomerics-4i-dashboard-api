      strong Disclaimer: 
      span Infomerics ratings are based on information provided by the issuer on an ‘as is where is’ basis. Infomerics credit ratings are an opinion on the credit risk of the issue / issuer and not a recommendation to buy, hold or sell securities.  Infomerics reserves the right to change, suspend or withdraw the credit ratings at any point in time. Infomerics ratings are opinions on financial statements based on information provided by the management and information obtained from sources believed by it to be accurate and reliable. The credit quality ratings are not recommendations to sanction, renew, disburse or recall the concerned bank facilities or to buy, sell or hold any security. We, however, do not guarantee the accuracy, adequacy or completeness of any information which we accepted and presumed to be free from misstatement, whether due to error or fraud. We are not responsible for any errors or omissions or for the results obtained from the use of such information. Most entities whose bank facilities/instruments are rated by us have paid a credit rating fee, based on the amount and type of bank facilities/instruments. In case of partnership/proprietary concerns/Association of Persons (AOPs), the rating assigned by Infomerics is based on the capital deployed by the partners/proprietor/ AOPs and the financial strength of the firm at present. The rating may undergo change in case of withdrawal of capital or the unsecured loans brought in by the partners/proprietor/ AOPs in addition to the financial performance and other relevant factors.
